## Usage

### Composer

Install and activate the plugin in your Shopware instance.

```shell
composer require family-office/dashboard-joke
```

The only thing that's left to do for the plugin to work is to build the administration.

```shell
bin/build-administration.sh
```

### Download

## Development

Clone the project into your Shopware installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:FamilyOfficeOrg/FamilyOfficeDashboardJoke.git
```

```shell
cd FamilyOfficeDashboardJoke
```

Install the development dependencies

```shell
make install
```

..and start developing! ðŸ¥³
